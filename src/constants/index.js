// As a Full-Stack Developer, I built a responsive hospital management dashboard using React.js and a secure backend server with Python and Django, ensuring HIPAA compliance. Collaborating with healthcare professionals, I tailored features to streamline workflows, optimized database performance for real-time updates, and implemented robust security protocols. By delivering scalable, reliable, and user-friendly solutions, I enhanced the efficiency of managing patient records, appointments, and medical data across hospital departments.
